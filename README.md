# Devops-Course-2024
This repository contains a detailed walkthrough of the concepts and technologies I learned during the DevOps Course FALL-2024, taught by @Saim Safdar.

# What I Have Learned
Throughout this course, I have gained hands on experience on multiple tools and technologies including:
- Git/Github
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- CI/CD (Jenkins & GitLab)
- Terraform (IaC)
- Cloud Kubernetes Offerings(AKS, EKS, GKE)
- Kyverno
- Istio Service Mesh
- Knative

  #Summarizing Blogs

# [Blog 1. GitOps: The Next Evolution of DevOps](https://medium.com/@fauzahmed2/gitops-the-next-evolution-of-devops-18630e82378b)
GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth for managing infrastructure and applications. By treating infrastructure as code, it ensures consistency, automation, and security across environments. Changes are versioned, reviewed, and automatically applied, reducing manual errors and improving collaboration. Popular tools like Flux, ArgoCD, and Terraform make GitOps an essential practice for modern cloud-native infrastructures.

# [Blog 2. Deploying AKS with Terraform: Why and How](https://medium.com/@fauzahmed2/deploying-aks-with-terraform-why-and-how-3918953b6926)
Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool that automates the provisioning and management of cloud resources, making it a powerful choice for deploying Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). By codifying infrastructure, Terraform ensures consistency, scalability, and version control across environments.
Its use of declarative configuration enables teams to avoid manual errors, improve traceability, and streamline complex infrastructure tasks. With Terraform, AKS deployments become more predictable, maintainable, and adaptable to modern practices like GitOps and CI/CD pipelines, significantly enhancing reliability and operational efficiency.
